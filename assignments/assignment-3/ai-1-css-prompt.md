I’m designing a personal portfolio website and want it to have a Spider-Man-inspired theme. I’m looking for a color scheme, typography, and design elements that capture the essence of Spider-Man, including his classic red, blue, and black colors, web patterns, and bold comic book aesthetics. The theme should feel dynamic, heroic, and sleek while remaining professional and easy to read. I also want subtle hover effects and a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop screens. Can you suggest design inspirations, UI examples, or existing websites with a similar feel?

HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment

Description:

In this asignment we made our portfolio that giving information related to me. Also in this assignmnet i used css to style the website. I also explore the difference between ai genrated vs human creted website. 

Approach / What I Did:

I structured the HTML to be simple and well-organized, using sections for easy navigation. The contact form have link where when you click on the name and it will open the link. Also theme swictcher it will let you switch themes. There are 4 themes to pick from. I also combined my theme with ai theme to create a hybrid theme.

Code Explanation:

<div class="theme-switcher">
    <h3>Theme Switcher</h3>
    <div class="theme-buttons">
        <button class="theme-button active" data-theme="styles">Hand-Written</button>
        <button class="theme-button" data-theme="ai-1">AI 1</button>
        <button class="theme-button" data-theme="ai-2">AI 2</button>
        <button class="theme-button" data-theme="hybrid">Hybrid</button>
    </div>
</div>

This code creates a "Theme Switcher" section with buttons that let users switch between different CSS themes (Hand-Written, AI-generated, and Hybrid).
